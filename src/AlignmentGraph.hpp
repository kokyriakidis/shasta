/*******************************************************************************

Class AlignmentGraph is used to compute an alignment of the markers
of two oriented reads.

In the alignment graph, each vertex corresponds to a pair of markers
in the two oriented reads that have the same k-mer.

Edges in the alignment  graph are created between vertices
that are sufficiently close on both oriented reads.
Each edge is assigned a weight based on the distances
between the two pairs of markers on each of the
oriented reads, measured using ordinals (not position).

To find a good alignment, we find a shortest path in the graph.
