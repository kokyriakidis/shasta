<h1>Compatibility across releases</h1>

<h2>Binary data compatibility</h2>
<p>
Depending on how you use Shasta, the code may generate for each run a
<code>Data</code> directory containing binary data
containing the data structures used for assembly. 
These binary data can be used for processing in two ways:

<ul>
<li>For 
<a href=InspectingResults.html>visualization/debugging</a> using the Shasta http server.
<li>For analysis using the Shasta 
<a href=Python.html>Python API</a>.
</ul>

Binary data created by a version of the Shasta assembler 
will generally be incompatible with a different version.
In other words, you will only be able to use the http server
or the Python API using the same Shasta version that 
was used for the run that you want to postprocess.



<h2>API compatibility</h2>
<p>
The Python API is subject to changes across Shasta versions.
Therefore, a Python script that was developed for a
specific Shasta version is generally not going to continue
to work with future versions.

<p>
Command line options for the Shasta executable and scripts
will generally change across releases.
There is no guarantee that options that were valid in a release
will remain valid in a future release.
It is also possible that the meaning of some options
will change from release to release, although a reasonable
effort will be made to limit this.


<h2>Release numbering</h2>

<p>
Shasta releases are named using
<a href='https://semver.org'>Semantic Versioning</a>
conventions. 
Because of the lack of compatibility described above,
it is likely that the Shasta major release number will
stay at 0 for the foreseeable future - that is, 
Shasta releases will be numbered <code>0.Y.Z</code>.
