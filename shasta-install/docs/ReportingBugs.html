<h1>Reporting problems or asking questions</h1>

<p>
If you bump into problems using Shasta,
or if you have questions or suggestions, 
feel free to 
<a href='https://github.com/paoloshasta/shasta/issues'>
submit an issue</a> on GitHub.

We will make an effort to respond to issues rapidly.
However, we are a small team
so please be patient.

<p>
Please use one issue per topic when possible:
<ul>
<li>If a new problem occurs, create a new issue rather than appending an old one.
It is fine to append an existing issue for discussion of the same problem for 
which the issue was originally filed.
<li>If two different problems arise
on the same run, please file two separate issues. 
</ul>
