# This Shasta assembly configuration was tested under the following conditions:
#  - ONT R10 chemistry, slow mode, chimera rate around 2%.
#  - Guppy 6 basecaller with "super" accuracy.
#  - Human genome at medium coverage (two flowcells, coverage around 45x).
#  - Haploid assembly.
# Under these conditions it produced a haploid assembly with N50 around 30 Mb
# and with base level accuracy limited mostly by heterozygosity 
# of the human genome.  
# This configuration might also be usable for other genomes 
# and at higher or lower  coverage, but that was not tested.
