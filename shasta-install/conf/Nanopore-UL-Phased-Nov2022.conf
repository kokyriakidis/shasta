# Configuration file that uses assembly mode 2
# to create a phased diploid assembly using 
# Nanopore Ultra-Long (UL) reads.

# This is known to work at least under the following conditions:
# - Oxford Nanopore Ultra-Long (UL) reads with read N50 50 Kb or more.
# - Guppy 5 or 6 base caller with "super" accuracy.
# - Human genome.
# - Coverage 60x to 80x. If you have more coverage, 
#   adjust --Reads.minReadLength or --Reads.desiredCoverage
#   to bring coverage down to this range.
#   For a human genome you can set --Reads.desiredCoverage 200G. 
# Compared to the Nanopore-UL-Phased-May2022 configuration,
# this provides better phasing accuracy without significantly decreasing
# the size of phased bubbles.
